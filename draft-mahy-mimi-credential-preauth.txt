   MIMI Preauthorization based on deep references to MLS Credentials
               draft-mahy-mimi-credential-preauth-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a syntax called claim pointers that identify
   specific items in structured credentials, which often have nested
   levels of hierarchy; and claim matchers that facilitate comparisons
   between items in credentials and a target value.  It also describes a
   new version of the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)
   preauthorization format using claim pointers and claim matchers.

1.  Introduction

   More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) room policy
   ([I-D.ietf-mimi-room-policy]) defines a format that allows potential
   joiners that are not enumerated beforehand to be preauthorized based
   on properties found in their Messaging Layer Security (MLS) [RFC9420]
   credentials.  The current version of the preauthorization format in
   Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-room-policy] is underspecified and was
   designed to work with individual claims in a JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [RFC7519] or CBOR Web Token (CWT) [RFC8392].  This document describes
   a syntax called claim pointers that can address claims nested inside
   JWT, CWT, and X.509 certificates [RFC5280], and provides richer
   matching rules called claim matchers, capable of matching sub parts
   of those claims and predicates based on them.  It could also be
   extended to credentials based on most general purpose structured data
   formats.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Structure of Credentials

   Structured data formats use a handful of strategies for representing
   and organizing data.  All common structured data formats offer some
   type of record structure semantics.  In this context this means a
   record contains a group of fields.  The names for record and fields
   differ across formats, as do their specific representations, as shown
   in the table below.

   +==========+==========================+================+============+
   | Format   | Representation           | Identifier of  | Name of    |
   |          | of record                | field          | field      |

                                  Table 1

   In this document, we are primarily interested in structured formats
   commonly used in credentials, specifically JSON Web Tokens (JWT),
   CBOR Web Tokens (CWT), and X.509 certificates (which use ASN.1) and
   their derivatives.  In the context of credentials, each of these
   specific fields is often described as a claim.

   In JSON, a record is represented as an object by convention.  The
   individual fields in the record are identified by the object name,
   which is always a quoted string.  Very rarely a record is represented
   as an array of heterogeneous elements.  Credential claims in a JWT
   are present in the JWT payload object.  Lists of homogenous elements
   are also arrays.

   In CBOR a record is typically represented as a map (very often with
   assigned integer map keys).  Records could also be represented as an
   array of heterogeneous elements.  Lists of homogenous elements are
   also arrays.

   In X.509v3, a certificate contains an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of exactly 3
   elements, the tbsCertificate ("to be signed certificate", which is
   analogous to the certificate payload), the signature algorithm, and
   the signature.  The certificate "payload" record is an ASN.1 SEQUENCE
   of 6 mandatory elements (certificate serial number, signature
   algorithm, issuer, validity, subject, and subject public key) and up
   to four optional elements (version, issuer unique ID, subject unique
   ID, and extensions).  For the purpose of matching elements in the
   sequence we will assign an index to each field (starting from 0) as
   if all 10 elements were present.  In this way, the overall structure
   is addressed by absolute position, while specific names, types, and
   extensions are identified using registered Object Identifiers (OIDs).
   The X.509 certificate extensions field contains a further syntax with
   a potentially large and varied basket of data structures.  Lists of
   items are represented as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF type, which is always
   of a single basic or composite type.  A composite type can contain a
   CHOICE of multiple subtypes.

   Records and lists in JSON, CBOR, and ASN.1 can be nested, sometimes
   deeply.  For example, the X.509 subjectAltName extension can contain
   a list of different types of names (DNS, URI, email, etc.) that all
   represent the subject.  In JWT or CWT credentials, an address claim
   might consist of several component claims (ex: country or postal
   code); a language claim might consist of a list of languages; or a
   groups claim might contain nested claims only relevant to that
   specific group.

   It is common to have a list of specific permission that have been
   granted in one context but not another.  For example a public
   relations manager might have regular access to resource A by virtue
   of being part of a company, access to resource B by virtue of being a
   full-time employee, regular access to resource C by virtue of being
   located in a particular country or office, moderator access to
   resource D by virtue of being a in public relations, and
   administrator access to resource E by virtue of being a manager.

4.  Requirements for Credential Inspection

   The following requirements were considered necessary to have a
   successful credential matching mechanism.

   1.   The mechanism can represent the difference between no match, and
        a match with a null or undefined value.

   2.   The mechanism can find a value in a JSON object or CBOR map by
        the object name or key name.

   3.   The mechanism can find an element in ASN.1 by its OID in a SET
        containing a two-element SEQUENCE.

   4.   The mechanism can find an element in a list, array, or SEQUENCE
        OF by its position.

   5.   The mechanism can find an element in an ASN.1 SEQUENCE that has
        any combination of its optional elements.

   6.   The mechanism can find a single element in an list or array
        where one of the list/array elements contains a single
        "identifying" field somewhere in the array value.

   7.   The mechanism can find an element among array elements that
        requires identification by multiple claim matchers joined with
        boolean logical ANDs (*Maybe*).

   8.   The mechanism can find a numerical value matching simple numeric
        predicates, such as greater than, or less than or equal to a
        target value.

   9.   The mechanism can match a target value to a well-defined part of
        a URI and email address claim.

   10.  The mechanism can compare a target value to an arbitrary
        substring of a value identified by a claim pointer (*Maybe*).

   The following requirements were considered and rejected as out of
   scope.

   *  Can the mechanism find claim values matching regular expressions?
      No, since regular expressions often present a security footgun; as
      we are defining a mechanism expressly to be used with credentials,
      this is an unacceptable risk.

   *  Can the mechanism find claims using arbitrary combinations of
      boolean logical statements containing OR statements in a claim
      pointer?  No, as this is likely to allow an unbounded explosion of
      claim combinations, and an OR mechanism can be introduced at the
      level of the application using the claim pointer mechanism.

   *  Can the mechanism find claims with information from partial or
      incomplete nested map keys?  No, since JSON only supports strings
      as object names, and CWT does not map keys with maps or arrays.
      However, this might be a straightforward extension.

   *  Can the mechanism find multiple claims with a given query?  No,
      this would imply a mechanism that could return a set of
      arbitrarily disjoint trees, instead of returning a single result
      (or no match).

5.  Matching claims

   In this section we introduce a method of matching claims in
   credentials that we describe here as Claim Pointers (which find a
   particular value), and Claim Matchers (which compare a value from a
   Claim Pointer to a specific value).  A claim pointer follows the
   hierarchy of a credential from its root to a specific claim, through
   a sequence of specifiers per level.  Each level is described using a
   ClaimPointerItem object.

   For the purposes of this section, a level of hierarchy in JSON is the
   value of any object, or an element of an array.  In CBOR a level of
   hierarchy is the value of any map key, an element of an array, or the
   contents of a tag.  In ASN.1 a level of hierarchy is generally an
   element of either a SEQUENCE or SEQUENCE OF.

   For explanatory purposes, we will provide an example JWT payload here
   to demonstrate some of the claim matching options.  Additional
   examples will be introduced as needed.

   {                                   # contents are at level 1
     "iss": "https://issuer.example",
     ...
     "known_entity": true,
     "orig_timestamp": 1549560720,
     "nodes": [                        # contents are at level 2
       {                               # contents are at level 3
         ...
         "processor": "DCBA-101777",
         "origin": {                   # contents are at level 4
           "country": "us",
           ...
         },
         "domain": "smart.example"
         "eur_per_hour": 273.15
       },
       ...
     ],
     "service_flags": [false, false, true, false]
   }

5.1.  Matching Map Keys, Object Names, and OIDs

   The value of an object in JSON or the value of a map in CBOR is
   accessed by its JSON name or CBOR map key, using the via_key pointer
   item type.  For JSON the key to be compared with the key is a double-
   quoted JSON string that matches the object name.

   For CBOR the key is the ordinary encoding
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-serialization] that matches the map key.  For example
   the CBOR map keys of 1 (unsigned integer), -1 (negative integer), '1'
   (byte string), "1" (text string), 1(0) (a timestamp at the start of
   the UNIX epoch), and 1.0 (float) match the keys of 0x01, 0x20, 0x41
   0x31, 0x61 0x31, 0xC1 0x00, and 0xF9 0x3C 0x00 respectively.

   In X.509, a common pattern is to have a single element SET of a
   SEQUENCE of two elements consisting of an OID and data element (its
   "value").  The data element of such a 2 element SEQUENCE matches when
   its key is equal to the DER representation of its OID (excluding the
   OID type and length).

   This pointer item points to ("returns") the value corresponding to
   the object name, map key, or element in the SEQUENCE.

   When evaluating the JWT payload above, the following claim pointer
   points at the value true, since that is the value of the known_entity
   claim.

   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "known_entity";

5.2.  Matching Lists and Sequences by Absolute Position

   The value of an element in an absolute position in a list is accessed
   using the array_position pointer item type.  The index value
   corresponds to the position counting from 0.

   The claim pointer below using the example JSON document above would
   point at the value true as well, the 3rd element of the service_flags
   array.

   /* pointer_item[0] points to entire array */
   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key; /* 0 */
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "service_flags";

   /* pointer_item[1] points to 3rd element (true) */
   pointer_item[1].item_type = array_position; /* 1 */
   pointer_item[1].index = 2;

   If there is no array, or the array does not have an element at the
   requested position, the claim pointer does not point at anything.  If
   the index above was instead 7, or the value of service_flags was not
   an array, the claim pointer would not point at any value.

   As previously mentioned, the elements of an X.509 SEQUENCE with
   optional elements (such as tbsCertificate) are given a logical
   position from zero as if all possible optional elements are present.

5.3.  Matching an Element in a List by an Identifier in the List

   The array_search claim pointer item type, can search a JSON or CBOR
   array, or an ASN.1 SEQUNCE OF, for the first entry which matched the
   nested claim matchers in nested_claim_pointer.

   The claim pointer below begins by pointing at the value of the entire
   nodes array.  Then, starting from the nodes array, its nested claim
   pointer points at the value of the processor object and compares it
   to the string value "DCBA-10177".  Finding a match, the top-level
   claim_pointer now points at the first element in the nodes array.
   Finally, the next claim pointer item looks for a domain object in the
   first element of the nodes array.  The claim pointer now points at
   the value "smart.example".

   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "nodes";
   /* pointer_item[0] points to entire array of nodes elements */

   /* pointer_item[1] searches for an item in the nodes array that has */
   /*  "processor" object matching DCBA-10177 using a case insensitive */
   /*  comparison                                                      */
   pointer_item[1].item_type = via_array_search;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.value = "processor";
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].semantics = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].match_as = utf8_ci;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].test_value = "Dcba-10177";

   /* pointer_item[1] ends pointing to 1st element in the node array */
   pointer_item[2].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[2].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[2].key.value = "domain";
   /* value of pointer_item[2] is "smart.example" */

   Instead imagine searching for the value of processor in the first
   element that matches the domain "smart.example".  We would use the
   following claim_pointer instead, which would point to the value
   "DCBA-10177" in the first element's processor object.

   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "nodes";
   /* pointer_item[0] points to entire array of nodes elements */

   /* pointer_item[1] searches for an item in the nodes array that has */
   /*  "domain" object matching "smart.example" using a domain name    */
   /*  comparison                                                      */
   pointer_item[1].item_type = via_array_search;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.value = "domain";
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].semantics = domain;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].match_as = domain;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].test_value = "smart.example";

   /* pointer_item[1] ends pointing to 1st element in the node array */
   pointer_item[2].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[2].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[2].key.value = "processor";
   /* value of pointer_item[2] is "DCBA-10177" */

   Finally, imagine that the value of the domain field was instead "xn--
   ingnieux-d1a.example", the match_as type was "punycode" and the
   test_value was "ingénieux.example".  This would also point to the
   same value ("DCBA-10177") since the punycode representation of the
   Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) or "punycode" representation of
   "ingénieux.example" is "xn--ingnieux-d1a.example".

   Full explanation of comparison rules will be discussed in section
   Section 7.

5.4.  Matching multiple claim pointers

   If no single value in an array element is sufficient to uniquely
   identify the target element, an array_search can search multiple
   claim_match elements.  While implementations may choose a variety of
   techniques to match multiple items, be aware that the claim matches
   need to be evaluated together.  One way to do this would be to start
   with the first item in an array, try each claim_match with that item
   until one of them fails to find a match, stopping at the first item
   that matches every claim_match, or returning no match if none is
   found.

   The following example presents the value of the processor object for
   the first element of the nodes item which matches both the domain
   "smart.example", and the origin country "us".

   /* pointer_item[0] matches the entire array under the nodes object */
   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "nodes";

   /* pointer_item[1] is an array_search with two claim_matches */
   /* it will point at the entire array element satisfying both *
   pointer_item[1].item_type = via_array_search;

   /* first claim_match matches "smart.example" in the domain object */
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.value = "domain"
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].semantics = domain
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].match_as = domain
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].value = "smart.example"

   /* second claim_match matches "us" in the country object in the */
   /*   origin object                                              */
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].key.value = "origin"
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[1].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[1].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].pointer_item[1].key.value = "country";
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].semantics = string;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].match = utf8_ci;
   pointer_item[1].claim_match[1].value = "us";

   /* pointer_item[2] points to the value of the processor object */
   pointer_item[2].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[2].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[2].key.value = "processor";

5.5.  Matching with Numerical Predicates

   In this example we use the concept of predicates to find an element
   with a numerical value in designed ranges.  In our example we are
   looking for an element of the nodes array with a eur_per_hour value
   greater than or equal to 200.

 /* pointer_item[0] points to entire array of nodes elements */
 pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
 pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
 pointer_item[0].key.value = "nodes";

 /* pointer_item[1] finds the first element with a `eur_per_hour`    */
 /*  floating point value greater than or equal to 200.00            */
 pointer_item[1].item_type = via_array_search;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.value = "processor";
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].semantics = number;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].match_as = finite_float;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].operation = greater_than_or_equal;
 pointer_item[1].claim_match[0].test_value = 200.0

 /* pointer_item[1] ends pointing to 1st element in the node array */

5.6.  Matching Parts of URIs and email addresses

   Standard URIs and email addresses have a complicated but predictable
   internal structure.  It is often useful to compare a specific
   component of a URI or an email address to a specific value.

   In the example fragments below the first claim_match will match when
   the domain of the URI matches "example.com".  The second matches when
   the email hostpart matches "example.com".  The last one matches when
   a MIMI URI where the first item in the URI path matches "r" (room).

   {
       "room-uri": "mimi://example.com/r/clubhouse",
       "email-checked": "alice@example.com"
   }

   /* first example */
   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "room-uri";
   semantics = uri;
   match_as = domain;
   test_value = "example.com";

   /* second example */
   pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   pointer_item[0].key.value = "email-checked";
   semantics = uri;
   match_as = hostpart;
   test_value = "example.com";

   /* third example */
   claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   claim_match[0].pointer_item[0].key.value = "room-uri";
   claim_match[0].semantics = uri;
   claim_match[0].match_as = scheme;
   claim_match[0].test_value = "mimi";
   claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].item_type = via_key;
   claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].key.type = string;
   claim_match[1].pointer_item[0].key.value = "room-uri";
   claim_match[1].semantics = uri;
   claim_match[1].match_as = uri_path;
   claim_match[1].operation = path_slice;
   claim_match[1].path_index = 0
   claim_match[1].test_value = "r";

5.7.  Matching Arbitrary Substrings

   match_as = uripath,

9.  Old text on Preauth

   Preauthorized users are MIMI users and external senders that have
   authorization to adopt a role in a room by virtue of certain
   credential claims or properties, as opposed to being individually
   enumerated in the participant list.  For example, a room for employee
   benefits might be available to join with the regular participant role
   to all full-time employees with a residence in a specific country;
   while anyone working in the human resources department might be able
   to join the same room as a moderator.  This data structure is
   consulted in two situations: for external joins (external commits)
   and external proposals when the requester does not already appear in
   the participant list; and separately when an existing participant
   explicitly tries to change its _own_ role.

      Only consulting Preauthorized users in these cases prevents
      several attacks.  For example, it prevents an explicitly banned
      user from rejoining a group based on a preauthorization.

   PreAuthData is the format of the data field inside the ComponentData
   struct for the Preauthorized Participants component in the
   application_data GroupContext extension.

   The individual PreAuthRoleEntry rules in PreAuthData are consulted
   one at a time.  A PreAuthRoleEntry matches for a requester when every
   Claim.claim_id has a corresponding claim in the requester's MLS
   Credential which exactly matches the corresponding claim_value.  When
   the rules in a Preauthorized users struct match multiple roles, the
   requesting client receives the first role which matches its claims.

      *TODO*: refactor Claims

   struct {
     /* MLS Credential Type of the "claim"  */
     CredentialType credential_type;
     /* the binary representation of an X.509 OID, a JWT claim name  */
     /* string, or the CBOR map claim key in a CWT (an int or tstr)  */
     opaque id<V>;
   } ClaimId;

   struct {
     ClaimId claim_id;
     opaque claim_value<V>;
   } Claim;

   struct {
     /* when all claims in the claimset are satisfied, the claimset */
     */ is satisfied */
     Claim claimset<V>;
     Role target_role;
   } PreAuthRoleEntry;

   struct {
     PreAuthRoleEntry preauthorized_entries<V>;
   } PreAuthData;

   PreAuthData preauth_list;
   PreAuthData PreAuthUpdate;

   PreAuthUpdate (which has the same format as PreAuthData) is the
   format of the update field inside the AppDataUpdate struct in an
   AppDataUpdate Proposal for the Preauthorized Participants component.
   If the contents of the update field are valid and if the proposer is
   authorized to generate such an update, the value of the update field
   completely replaces the value of the data field.

      As with the definition of roles, in MIMI it is not expected that
      the definition of Preauthorized users would change frequently.
      Instead the claims in the underlying credentials would be modified
      without modifying the preauthorization policy.

   Changing Preauthorized user definitions is sufficiently disruptive,
   that an update to this component is not valid if it appears in the
   same commit as any Participant List change, except for user removals.

   Because the Preauthorized users component usually authorizes non-
   members, it is also a natural choice for providing concrete
   authorization for policy enforcing systems incorporated into or which
   run in coordination with the MIMI Hub provider or specific MLS
   Distribution Services.  For example, a preauthorized role could allow
   the Hub to remove participants and to ban them, but not to add any
   users or devices.  This unifies the authorization model for members
   and non-members.
